## Misc
This is my first theme, so if you something amiss, please feel free to file and issue! I'm sure there are things I missed. 

Any relevant changes for each version are documented in the changelog. Please update and check the changelog before filing any issues, as they may have already been taken care of.

This theme was inspired from favorite color palette used in my personal [portfolio](https://coderdiaz.me).
